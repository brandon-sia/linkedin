    <p>Hey! I'm your friendly technology accountant. I love experimenting with anything tech related and this has lead to my current career in automation for accounting.</p>
    <p>Since young, I like the idea of pursing knowledge. Businesses, science, art or history, the genre doesn't really matter. There is always something to learn every day and I have committed myself to a lifelong journey of trying new things and having an open mind.</p>
